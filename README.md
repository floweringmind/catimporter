# catimporter
Imports categories into Magento 2

This imports a list of categories into a root folder. You need to set the root id in catimporter.php.

I suggest you use Excel to re-order your data to be alphabetical. 

Currently I don't error check, so I suggest that you remove commas (,) and replace with periods (.)
